    TimeSeriesSplit

Key Accomplishments

    Imported historical stock data for NVDA, AMD, and TSLA from CSV files.
    Preprocessed data, including feature scaling and date formatting.
    Developed LSTM models for stock price prediction.
    Implemented time series data splitting and training/testing datasets.
    Trained the LSTM model on historical data for NVDA stock.
    Evaluated model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
